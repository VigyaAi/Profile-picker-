ACADEMIC PROJECT
PARTIAL  REPLACE  OF  FINE  AGGREGATE  IN
CONCRETE MIX DESIGN
Description: This paper reports on an experimental program to
investigate the effect of using copper slag as a replacement of
fine  aggregate on the strength properties. Copper slag  is the
waste material of matte smelting and refining of copper such
that  each  ton  of copper generates  approximately  2.5  tons of
copper  slag.  Copper  slag  is  one  of  the  materials  that  is
considered as a waste which could have a promising future in
construction Industry as partial or full substitute of aggregates.
For this research work, M25 grade concrete was used and tests
were  conducted  for  various  proportions  of  copper  slag
replacement with sand of 0 to 100% in concrete. The obtained
results were compared with those of control concrete made with
ordinary Portland cement and sand.

In my project I built a robot handled wirelessly with RF frequency of 433 MHz of 
Transmitter and Receiver. The robot consists of a camera which records audio visuals 
wirelessly in real-time scenario. It also consists of a fire alarm which buzzes if it detects any 
fire around which is also known as temperature sensor. This robot has great use in various 
industries where things are turning micro. Areas where human contact cannot be made this 
robot can be sent in substitute. It has its applications in water by making it an aqua robot and 
other myriad applications in many other fields of work.
